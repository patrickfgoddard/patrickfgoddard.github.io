Fast forward to 2013...

Restarting blogging for a few reasons.  One, as an excuse to play around with new tools. Second, to build my online "voice" more.

[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) has been my tool of choice since 2007.  Knowledge of Drupal has giving me great opportunities for employment and to meet some great folks through the community.

But as should go without saying, technology and especially web technology, moves at hyperspeed, and I find myself woefully unable to keep up.

Awhile back, I had noticed a few folks had switch their blogs over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  And in poking around learning this, I also learned that Jekyll is [Github](http://github.com)'s method for publishing pages on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  Awesome!

Add in Bootstrap's integration with Jekyll and other tools like [Less](http://www.lesscss.org/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and more, and I get to kill many birds with one stone. Basically, to catch up on a bunch of modern techniques. Push yourself, dude.

So at the moment, this blog is going to launch with the default theme, but will be tweaking as time goes on. 

By the way, I still am very much involved in Drupal, but excited about branching out into other tools.
